        <p>
            Founded by four students together during the year of 2023 to sell mainly stickers and posters
            which later on became to be known as Snap 'N' Stick as the demand for the products increased and increased.
            Taking the student community of yeshwanthpur campus by force, the team has even ventured to the central campus 
            where the amount of sales has far exceeded the expectations of the team.
            Now a famous Snap 'N' Stick for its impressive quality at the cheapeast prices, the team is moving forward with the ambitious plan
            to broaden the scope of Snap 'N' Stick to make a name which stands for its quality, prices and modern designs.
